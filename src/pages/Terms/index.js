                  <p>
                    Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
                    (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a
                    recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing
                    cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis,
                    depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
                    purchasing a Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle,
                    your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact
                    same conditions unless you cancel it or ZontLabs OÜ cancels
                    it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
                    your online account management page or by contacting
                    ZontLabs OÜ customer support team. A valid payment method,
                    including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the
                    payment for your subscription. You shall provide ZontLabs OÜ
                    with accurate and complete billing information including
                    full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a
                    valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
                    information, you automatically authorize ZontLabs OÜ to
                    charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account
                    to any such payment instruments. Should automatic billing
                    fail to occur for any reason, ZontLabs OÜ will issue an
                    electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
                    manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
                    payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on
                    the invoice.

                    (“Free Trial”). You may be required to enter your billing
                    information in order to sign up for Free Trial. If you do
                    enter your billing information when signing up for Free
                    Trial, you will not be charged by ZontLabs OÜ until Free
                    Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period,
                    unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be
                    automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for
                    the type of Subscription you have selected. At any time and
                    without notice, ZontLabs OÜ reserves the right to (i) modify

                    ZontLabs OÜ, in its sole discretion and at any time, may
                    modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any
                    Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of

                    Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate

                    Subscription fee amount.

                  <h5>21. Termination</h5>
                  <p>
                    We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to
                    Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
                    under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and
                    without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of
                    Terms. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply
                    discontinue using Service. All provisions of Terms which by
                    their nature should survive termination shall survive
                    termination, including, without limitation, ownership
                    provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations
                    of liability.

                  <h5>22. Governing Law</h5>
                  <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance
                    with the laws of Republic of Estonia without regard to its
                    conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right
                    or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver
                    of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to
                    be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
                    provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms
                    constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
                    Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we
                    might have had between us regarding Service.

                  <p>
                    We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and
                    any service or material we provide via Service, in our sole
                    discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any
                    reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at any time
                    or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access
                    to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users,
                    including registered users.

                  <p>
                    We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms
                    on this site. It is your responsibility to review these
                    Terms periodically. 9 Your continued use of the Platform
                    following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept
                    and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this
                    page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are
                    binding on you. By continuing to access or use our Service
                    after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound
                    by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms,
                    you are no longer authorized to use Service.

                  <h5>25. Waiver And Severability</h5>
                  <p>
                    No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in
                    Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such
                    term or condition or a waiver of any other term or
                    condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or
                    provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provision. If any provision of Terms is held by a
                    court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
                    provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
                    extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will
                    continue in full force and effect.
